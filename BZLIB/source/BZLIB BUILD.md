Huge thank you to Phil Ross for his Visual Studio libbz2.dll Build found here: https://github.com/philr/bzip2-windows

https://github.com/philr/bzip2-windows/releases/tag/v1.0.8.0

Windows binaries (32-bit and 64-bit) for bzip2 version 1.0.8.

Source code for bzip2 can be obtained from https://www.sourceware.org/pub/bzip2/bzip2-1.0.8.tar.gz.

All binaries depend on the Visual Studio 2015 C Runtime Library (vcruntime140.dll). This can be installed using the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 installer. See Microsoft's Latest Supported Visual C++ Downloads page for download links.

Rename libbz2-static.lib from bzip2-dev-1.0.8.0-win-x64.zip to libbz2.lib (Does not require a .dll)
